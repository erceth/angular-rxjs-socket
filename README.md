# rxjs Socket

Angular, rxjs and socket.io conglomeration.  This is a proof of concept to see if I could se angular, Reactive Programming concepts and socket.io all together.  It was a success.

The Rxjs library wraps around the socket creating a stream.  Angular subscribes to those streams creating a seamless flow of data from the server to the HTML.
